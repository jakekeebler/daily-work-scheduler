# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

This website contains a planner where you can type text into any of the rows and save them to local storage. Upon refreshing the page, any saved text will still be there. The website also knows the current hour of the day thanks to the moment.js API and color codes each row based on past hours, present hour, and future hours of the day.
